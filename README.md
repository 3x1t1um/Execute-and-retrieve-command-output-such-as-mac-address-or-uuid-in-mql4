# Execute-command-in-mql4

You can save the command output in a text file - it's all in the code. Modify it as you see fit, as there is little documentation on the subject and none on how to get the output in mql4 with the ShellExecuteW function.

The first version retrieves the uuid and the 2nd the mac address, so it's up to you to manipulate the text afterwards and target the right elements.
